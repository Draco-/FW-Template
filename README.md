FW-Template
===========

FW-Template is a application development framework, using PyQt4 to setup a complete
GUI controlled python application.

The framework is based on the excelent tutorial of Boudewijn Rempt 'GUI Programming with Python: QT Edition'
which can be found at -- http://www.commandprompt.com/community/pyqt/?page=pyqtbook --

Though this tutorial is based on PyQt3, in my opinion it shows a well structured approach
to programming larger (non trivial) applications.

I have adopted the structures and framwork elements to my needs, porting them also to PyQt4
and Python 2.7
I tried to keep the framework modular, thus allowing users to leave elements, they do not
need for the moment. I also tried to add extensive comments, to enable further use with a
real application.
